# JavaScript Loan App

I build a `User` friendly **Loan Calculator** using `JavaScript`. All the functionalities of the App are written in `expressive arrow functions`. It's a learning curve for seasoned `JavaScript Developers` that wants to understand the current trends and what has been added to `JavaScript` in **2019.** The App can be extentend to a bigger application later on. I am currently working on a cutting edge learning platform for **Tech Lovers all around the world.** The aim of the platform is offer free skills to the entire tech community around the world
